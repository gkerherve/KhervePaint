"""Render the KhervePaint mark into a macOS ``.icns``.

The macOS counterpart of ``make_icon.py``: same mark, different
container. Written to an explicit path (the spec puts it under
``build/``) rather than committed, so no binary that only one platform
ever reads sits in the tree:

    python packaging/make_icns.py build/KhervePaint.icns

The source is the committed 1024px export in ``packaging/icons/`` rather
than a fresh Qt render, so the icon needs neither a display nor Pillow on
the build machine. ``sips`` and ``iconutil`` are both part of macOS, so a
Mac build needs nothing installed beyond the app's own requirements;
off-macOS it falls back to Pillow's ICNS writer so the script is at least
testable there.

Regenerate ``packaging/icons/*.png`` with ``make_icon.py``'s renderer
after editing the mark in ``khervepaint/icons.py``.
