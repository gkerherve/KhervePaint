"""One-shot macOS build: .app + ad-hoc signature + DMG.

The macOS counterpart of ``build_installer.py``. Run from the project
root, on a Mac, with the interpreter that has PyInstaller:

    python packaging/build_macos.py                  # everything
    python packaging/build_macos.py --skip-freeze    # reuse dist/KhervePaint.app

Produces, in ``dist/``:

* ``KhervePaint-<version>-macOS-<arch>.dmg`` — drag-to-install disk image
* ``KhervePaint-macOS-<arch>.dmg``           — stable-name copy, the name a
                                               "latest release" link can use

The steps, in order:

1. Freeze with PyInstaller. On macOS the spec ends in ``BUNDLE``, so this
   yields ``dist/KhervePaint.app``, not a bare folder. The spec resolves
   and writes ``khervepaint/VERSION`` itself, so the bundle reports the
   commit it was actually built from.
2. Ad-hoc sign. Apple Silicon refuses to execute an unsigned Mach-O at
   all, so this is not cosmetic. It is *not* notarization — see
   ``README.macos.md`` for what that means for the person downloading it.
3. Seal it into a DMG with the ``/Applications`` symlink that makes the
   mounted window a drag-install.

There is no installer to compile: on macOS a drag-install replaces the
whole bundle atomically, so the upgrade problems ``installer.nsi`` works
around cannot happen here. There is likewise no portable zip — a ``.app``
already is one.
